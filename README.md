#Compbiz Computer Business Management Software

##

This is a small package designed to handle and track jobs with a ticket-style system. I had originally designed it specifically for a plan I had to start a small local computer repair business in conjunction with an HTML5 phone application to allow users to track the status of their machine.

However a few friends had asked for use of it for other purposes, and I ended up having a few other projects come up that took precedence.

The user and account system works perfectly with the ground work laid to implement the Jobs system.
